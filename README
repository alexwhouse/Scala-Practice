Welcome to my open GitHub repository.

I will be using this as an area to practice Scala by writing examples from books, as well as my own small programs.

If you stumble upon this and have any questions I will be more than happy to assist you. Otherwise I make no guarantees on the code and/or content within this repository.

In addition I have not used Git before so the commits will be somewhat haphazard.
